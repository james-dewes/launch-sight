# Launch Sight 
NASA Appathon 2016 project for the [Launch a Global Experience Challenge](https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/space-station/launch-a-global-experience "Global Experience Challenge")

Creating a low cost, immersive experience of a rocket launch, combining sound, vibration, pressure, wind and 360 video, designed as if the user were observing the launch from only a few miles away and controlled by an easy to use application.

##Who is the project for?
Aimed towards people who cannot make it to a launch in person Launch Sight gives an affordable experience for anyone to enjoy.

EDUCATION - The idea behind Launch Sight's implementation is that it can be used in the education system as a project aimed to spark an interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths. This project is great for small teams to work together designing and creating their own launch experience with the need for only a few resources (and plenty of cardboard). Launch Sight, when used as a school project would enable students to enhance their problem solving skills and creativity as well as giving them an opportunity to learn how to code.

INTERACTIVE MUSEUM - By taking the modules and recreating them with 3D printing you are able to create a long lasting solution perfect for an interactive or life sciences museum. Launch Sight in museums would mean anyone around the world can be at a launch. Whether they experience the Apollo 11 or the SLS, the experience is personal. Each time is different, making it a wonderful attraction to revisit.

You can make it cheaper! Our fan was broken electrical waste, as was our subwoofer. While not advisable, you can solder the batteries in place, there are many alternatives to a breadboard including soldering components directly to the L293S chip. Using a phone charger means you don't have to have a separate power supply for the Pi, chopping the build down to just £50 and if you are like us, you probably have a few of these parts already, making the whole lot cost even less.

##To Do list
While this is not a how to, it covers some of things we had did for our build. It does not include the visual effects

* [Assemble motor and controller](http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Control-DC-Motor-via-Bluetooth/)
* Attach Bluetooth controller
* Test running motor via Bluetooth
* Get subwoofer working (it was junk after all)
* Get fan working
* [Build motor controller for fan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pi-motor)
* Install core code on Raspberry Pi
* Test remote
* Test Pi output
* Install the app
* Program the NFC in cardboard to open the app
* Strap subwoofer to a chair
* Connect the sub
* Point the fan in the right direction
* Run Python file main.py
* Put your NFC enabled phone in the Cardbaord
* Test full rig
